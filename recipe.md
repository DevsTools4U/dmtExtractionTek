# DMT (Dimethyl-Triptyline) Extraction From Mimosa Hostilis (Jurema Preta) Root Bark

per 1g DMT:

	gear:
		2 pots
		1 pyrex glass dish w/ lid
		1 1L heat-resistant glass jar/beaker w/lid
		1 cheesecloth
		1 glass vial
		1 heat-resistant stirrer
		1 glass turkey baster
		1 plastic bag
		1 plastic hair-tie 
		1 razorblade

	ingredients:
		Water
		White Vinegar
		50g Mimosa Hostilis (Jurema Preta) Root Bark *purple dye*
		50g Sodium Hydroxide *lye*
		50mL Heptane


## Steps 1-13: "Cleaning" the root bark
	
1. Place 50g root bark in freezer for 8 hrs.

2. Grind the root bark into a powder. 

3. Add 50g powdered root bark to one pot.

4. Pour 750mL water into pot.

5. Pour 200 mL vinegar into pot.

5. Mix pot mixture for 2-3 minutes.

6. Bring mixture in pot to a boil.

7. Once at boil, lower heat and let boil for 1 hr.

8. After 1hr, place cheese cloth on jar and pour pot mixture through it into jar.

10. Pour this jar mixture into the second pot.

11. Repeat steps 3-10 3 times reusing root bark but adding new water and vinegar each time.

12. Once you have completed this process, bring second pot mixture to a boil and reduce volume by 1/3 (we won't need the powdered root bark anymore as we have "cleaned" the DMT out with previous process).

13. When the second pots filtered product has reduced by 1/3, pour remaining mixture into a jar.

## Steps 14-28: Drawing DMT from our "cleaned" jar mixture into aqueous solution.

14. Slowly, add 50g Sodium Hydroxide to jar mixture.

15. Mix mixture for 2-3 minutes.

16. Place plastic bag on the opening of the vesicle and use hair-tie to secure the plastic bag to create a "lid" of the jar. 

17. Let sit for 1 hr. 

18. Place the jar mixture in the pot. 

19. Add water to the pot until waters height matches up with the meniscus of the mixture.

20. Remove jar from pot of water.

21. Heat water to around 80-90 degrees C.

22. Wile water is heating, remove "lid" of jar and slowly add 50 mL of Heptane to the mixture.

23. Secure jar with its lid and shake mixture in jar until water has reached temp.

24. When water has reached temp, turn off burner. Also remove lid from jar and reapply "lid" to jarred mixture.

25. Now place jar mixture into pot of heated water and wait 2.5hrs.

26. After 2 hrs, remove jar from pot.

27. Reheat water to 80-90 degrees C, open/stir mixture, secure mixture with its lid, and shake until water reaches temp.

28. Reapply the plastic bag/hairtie "lid" on jar and place jar back in heated pot for 2 hrs.

## Steps 29-37: Forming crystals.

29. Now you will be able to notice an aqueous layer that has formed on top of the mixture.  

30. Using the glass turkey baster, draw up this aqueous layer and release into the glass pyrex dish. ***be careful to not draw up any of the other mixture as it will cause impurities 

31. Once most of this aqueous layer has been transferred to the pyrex dish, affix "lid" back onto jar and store in dark storage (we can use this again).

32. Secure the pyrex dish with its lid and place in freezer for 12 hrs.

33. After 12 hrs remove dish and open lid. You will notice the aqueous layer with what looks like small white crystals (DMT). 

34. Retrieve the base mixture and use the turkey baster to transfer the residual aqueous layer back into the vesicle mixture while being careful to not draw up crystals.

35. Place "lid" on jar and place in a dark storage. 

36. Let the residual aqueous product evaporate from the pyrex dish. You can use fans to speed this process, but at its current state, the DMT is very fragile and may cause the crystals to turn to goo. Keep an eye on it at this point in the process you will be able to tell.

37. Once you are left with the crystals in the dish, use the razorblades to transfer the crystals into the glass vial. You have now created what is known as "freebase dmt".

You can repeat steps 14-29 for as long as your mixture produces crystals. You may need to add more heptane after a couple of pulls. 

## Freebase Storage:

The freebase is very fragile and can be damaged by light and heat. Wrapping the vial in tin foil and placing in a freezer should keep it fresh for some time.

## What now?

A common way this freebase is applied is by throwing it in a freebase pipe or electronic vaporizer. It is potent at this stage and careful use is suggested. This method however, is an inefficient process and product can be lost. The alternative would be the formation of DMT Fumarate.

# DMT Fumarate Synthesis 

per 1g DMT freebase:

	gear:
		2 glass jars/beakers
		2 stirrers
		1 pyrex dish

	ingredients:
		1g freebase DMT
		300mg Fumaric Acid
		100mL Heptane
		

1. Measure 50mL of heptane in each jar.

2. In one add and dissolve 1g DMT.

3. In the other, stir in 300mg of fumaric acid. This takes a little while longer.

4. Once both dmt and fumaric acid have dissolved, combine into one jar and stir thoroughly.

5. Pour solution into pyrex dish and let evaporate. The resulting substance is DMT Fumarate.

DMT Fumarate makes the DMT more stable so you don't have to keep it in a freezer. Also, unlike freebase, one can "do" the DMT by dissolving the DMT Fumarate in water.
